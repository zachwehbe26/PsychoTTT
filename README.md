# PsychoTTT

### Mask up and battle!
- Use your psycho-transforming gadget to become a masked killer with multiple buffs to help you.
- Buffs include increased movement speed and damage, and you receive a radar from the traitor shop.
- This could be used to kill terries quicker with the damage buff and reposition rapidly with the speed bonus.
### Normalcy and its shortcomings
- The gadget also gives you the option to remove the mask at any time.
- Doing so disables your buffs but also returns your player model back to the default.
- Although the psycho is a traitor, they have no shop and only the gadget with them.
- This makes the psycho a powerful, but one-dimensional killer.
